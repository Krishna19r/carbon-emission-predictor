## Regression-Based Carbon Emission Prediction from Cloud Resource Usage

##  Project Overview
With the rapid adoption of cloud computing, even small web applications contribute to significant carbon emissions due to energy-intensive data centers. However, most small developers lack tools to estimate the environmental impact of their cloud usage. 

This project presents a regression-based machine learning model that predicts carbon emissions generated by cloud resource usage in small web applications.The model uses cloud infrastructure parameters such as CPU utilization, memory consumption, storage usage, data transfer, and server region to estimate CO₂ emissions.

The system aims to promote sustainable cloud computing by enabling developers to make environmentally responsible deployment decisions.
